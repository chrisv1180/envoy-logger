# How to access InfluxDB

  url: http://localhost:8086
  token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  org: home

  # Which InfluxDB bucket to send measurements.
  # This can be useful to control different data-retention rules
  # alternatively use the "bucket" key if you want everything to be sent to the
  # same bucket
  bucket_hr: high_rate
  bucket_lr: low_rate
  bucket_mr: medium_rate
  # bucket: all_data

  # true if hourly or daily data should be calculated and saved in bucket_mr / bucket_lr
  #calc_daily_data: true
  #calc_hourly_data: true

# Since the Envoy only tracks panel-level inverter production by serial number,
# it can be useful to provide InfluxDB measurements with additional tags that
# further describe your panels. This is completely optional, but can be useful
# metadata for your dashboard.
# You can figure out which inverter is which by logging into https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/
# and viewing: https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/pv/systems/<account number>/array_layout_x.json
# This will contain the X/Y coordinates of each inverter/panel.
# Since my layout is pretty simple, I chose to tag them with simple row/column numbers.
# Up to you to define a labeling scheme that works for you.
